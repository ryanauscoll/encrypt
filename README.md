# File Encrypter with XOR Algorithm

## Overview

This is a simple file encryption/decryption tool that utilizes the XOR algorithm to provide basic encryption. The user interface is built using GTK, giving it a modern look with custom styles. The application allows users to encrypt or decrypt files using a specified key.

### Features
- **Simple XOR Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt or decrypt files using the XOR algorithm.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built using GTK with a modern and intuitive interface.
- **File Browser**: Users can browse and select input/output files easily via a file chooser dialog.
- **Responsive Design**: The application resizes and aligns elements for a clean look.
- **Customizable Key**: Users can provide their own custom key for encryption and decryption.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (requires GTK installation).
